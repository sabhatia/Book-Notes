The Advantage
=============
Organizational Health:

What prevents execs and leadership from obtaining good health:

1. Sophistication - It's not complicated, so too simple for some to pursue
2. Adrenalin - Too caught up in day-to-day firefighting to be bothered
3. Quantification - You can't put metrics around it (at least not yet), so hard for some to state whether they have achieved it or not.
