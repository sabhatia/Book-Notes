Vision
========

Chapter 1: Start
----------------
- Startups need to have Vision==>Strategy==>Product
It's like a launching a car - Having means of land-transport is your vision.
A car is the product.
Tuning the engine is example of tuning one of the 'engines of growth'.

Continuously get feedback so tune and improve the engine. Similar to our everyday release activities.
Deciding to launch a car and doing test drives is example of product strategy. What features to tune.
Is decidedly different from launching a rocket. Feedback and controls and experiments are much harder to run.
 - Let's build cars, not rockets. Get quick feedback on handling, and keep tuning the engines.

Chapter 2: Define
-----------------
*START-UP*: 
" A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty."

Key Terms: 
1. Human institution
2. New Product or Service
3. Condition of extreme uncertainty

Those operating under above conditions are all 'entrepreneurs'. 

Example of Snaptax:
- Decide to launch a computer/phone based tax return.
- Started only with handling California tax returns. Got 350,000 downloads in first week.
- Was a small team that was allowed to operate independently inside Intuit.
- Had turned the culture from one experiment every tax season to 500 experiments over course of 3 months pre-tax season.
- Turned people from politicians (fight for that one feature) to actual entrepreneurs.

Chapter 3: Measure
-------------------
- Most companies track 'vanity metrics' - Is the product on time, within budget and with quality?
- First question is now 'How is it built', it's 'Whether should this be built?'
- Rather than track milestone times, outstanding bugs, and budget, track 'validated' metrics.
- What happens if the product is successful? Check customer downloads, revenue per customer.
- Story of IMVU. What was the strategy? The pitfalls of wanting vanity metrics and *not* wanting to release
- Realizing building the wrong product. How they pivoted (IM focused, to separate IM based strategy).

Chapter 4: Experiment
---------------------
Lean startup approach is like a scientific experiment. 

* You have assumptions
* Make a prediction (a hypothesis) based on those assumptions
* Run and experiment to 
* Measure the prediction and hence validate/invalidate the assumptions

In lean startup, the idea is to run experiments and validate assumptions before you doing extensive building.

Two important hypothesis to solve in any product. What is the:
1. 	Value Hypothesis: What problem is being solved and is the product doing a good job of it? Is it delivering value to the customer who is using it?
	A more detailed way to ask this question is:
	i.	 Do customers recognize the problem you are trying to solve
	ii.  If there was a solution, would they buy it
	iii. Would they but it from us?
	iv.  Can *we* build a solution for that problem?
2. Growth Hypothesis: Once we have a customer, how are we going to spread it? How will *new* customers discover the product or service?

Eg: Zappos, HP's volunteering program, Village Laundry Service, CFPB (Consumer Finance Protection Board)
 
Steer
=====
Vision leads to steering. Need to go through the Build-Measure-Lean feedback loop multiple times to test assumptions and quickly tune the product.

Chapter 5: Leap
---------------
Figure out the 'leap of faith' assumptions in the business plan. This is a key step that most miss. Eg: Facebook. Most think they can 'grow' like facebook by advertising. But the key is that facebook/hotmail grew without any advertising. Once folks used it, they wanted to tell others about it. Not by 'theater'.
Another way to validate assumptions is by using Analogs/Antilogs. Eg: iPod: Walkman was the analog, Napster was the antilog. Didn't build iTunes that way.

Also, keep in mind what are the key 
* Value Hypothesis and 
* Growth Hypothesis

Value Hypothesis: Some companies maybe profitable in short-term, but burn out long term. Eg: Ponzi Schemes - no value.
Others like amazon are not still profitable, but still providing lots of value.
Best way to test validate leap of faith assumptions is Genchi Gembutsu (By Toyota) - which is "Go and see for yourself". Probably translates for us to 'Design Thinking'. Observe the customer's problem, don't just accept other's word for it. Eg: Toyota Minivan.

Chapter 6: Test
---------------
Idea to test your assumptions as soon as possible with minimum waste. This is where MVP comes in - how do you quickly test your assumptions. Several examples:

1. Groupon: Picked up coupons - created a PDF and emailed it to people. Just to see if the concept would stick.
2. Box: Folks didn't understand they had a problem. And building it across different OSes was its value but take too much time. So just created a youtube video explaining how it'll work
3. Food on the Table (Concierge Service): CEO and COO actually asking beta customers what they want, deliver it and get feedback of how was it.

Quality in MVP: Don't get caught in the loop of adding too much quality. Your goal is usually to find out is it the right thing. Fixing all bugs can lead to more waste (for learning) and fatter MVP to add more features since timelines increase. Eg: IMVU's teleportation feature.
This is not easy to achieve - specially if we have patent, or first mover issues. But solve-able. Don't solve everything - but commit to rapidly iterating and fixing.

Chapter 7: Measure

Chapter 8: Pivot
----------------
Application to SJC
------------------
- Who thinks this is AVC?
- Who thinks this is Shadow-IT?
- Who thinks this is Unified Proxy?
- Build-Measure-Learn
	- Building and engine
	-- BML over and over to fine tune/optimize on execution
	-- At some point you decide you're off and decide to Pivot on strategy
	-- Perhaps at some point need to change the Vision(??) (need a new startup?)
- Validated-Accounting
- Scaling up
- Turning doing a startup from an ART to science (BML)
- Great examples of startups (loved the one about learning - instruction/group
