Vision
========

Chapter 1: Start
- Startups need to have Vision==>Strategy==>Product
It's like a launching a car - Having means of land-transport is your vision.
A car is the product.
Tuning the engine is example of tuning one of the 'engines of growth'.

Continuously get feedback so tune and improve the engine. Similar to our everyday release activities.
Deciding to launch a car and doing test drives is example of product strategy. What features to tune.
Is decidedly different from launching a rocket. Feedback and controls and experiments are much harder to run.
 - Let's build cars, not rockets. Get quick feedback on handling, and keep tuning the engines.

*START-UP*: 
------------
" A startup is a human institution designed to create a new product or service under conditions of extreme uncertainty."

Key Terms: 
1. Human institution
2. New Product or Service
3. Condition of extreme uncertainty

Those operating under above conditions are all 'entrepreneurs'. 

Example of Snaptax:
- Decide to launch a computer/phone based tax return.
- Started only with handling California tax returns. Got 350,000 downloads in first week.
- Was a small team that was allowed to operate independently inside Intuit.
- Had turned the culture from one experiment every tax season to 500 experiments over course of 3 months pre-tax season.
- Turned people from politicians (fight for that one feature) to actual entrepreneurs.

- Who thinks this is Shadow-IT?
- Who thinks this is Unified Proxy?
- Build-Measure-Learn
	- Building and engine
	-- BML over and over to fine tune/optimize on execution
	-- At some point you decide you're off and decide to Pivot on strategy
	-- Perhaps at some point need to change the Vision(??) (need a new startup?)
- Validated-Accounting
- Scaling up
- Turning doing a startup from an ART to science (BML)
- Great examples of startups (loved the one about learning - instruction/group
