The Advantage

Introduction: Organizational Health
================================

What prevents execs and leadership from obtaining good health:

1. Sophistication - It's not complicated, so too simple for some to pursue
2. Adrenalin - Too caught up in day-to-day firefighting to be bothered
3. Quantification - You can't put metrics around it (at least not yet), so hard for some to state whether they have achieved it or not.

What is Organization Health:
(Very Wishy-Washy): When it's leadership, strategy, execution and culture align together to deliver a common goal.

Organizations needs to be have good *Strategy* and good *Health*.

Strategy(Bad Term): Engineering, Marketing, Finance, HR (Structure)
Health: Culture, Moral, Productivity and Minimal Politics

Structure/Parts is just the table-stakes. Health is what differentiates whether or not you are going to be successful. Health is what allows org to function as a collective unit and what allows it to fix something when it detects is not working.

Why do organizations not spend more time cultivating health? Not taught much in academia, or reported as high-flying in journals. 

How to build Organizational Health:

1. Cohesive Team
2. Create Clarity
3. Communicate Clarity
4. Re-enforce Clarity

Chapter 1: Cohesive Team
========================

What is it: A group of individuals collectively responsible for achieving a common goal/objective for the organization.

Collectively Responsible:
	- Of course offer resources and budgets to others (hard to do), but obvious
	- Also devote time and energy to other's goals, not just their own.
	Eg: How do we handle SWG? How do we handle AVC? What's blocking us?
	
Common Goal:
	- Obvious. Failure of a project is failure of entire team to come together. Not just that person in charge.
	- 
	
Elements of a cohesive team:
	A. Trust
	B. Conflict
	C. Commitment
	D. Accountability
	E. Results
	
1.A: Building Trust
	What it isn't? Not that someone will do something they say.
	What it is? Ability to be able to go into a meeting, have the safety net to say, "I messed up", or "I need help" or "I'm sorry". And trust that the team will help you succeed or learn or both.
	
	- Vulnerability: Leader goes first
	- Profiling: Myers-Briggs or Team-Space
	- Attribution: Try to understand, than be understood.
	
1.B. Mastering Conflict
	- Why do we want it? To guard against Passive Resistance.
	- Be ready for Discomfort
	- Beware of Conflict Avoidance
	- Set Rules of Engagement
		- Silence means *DIS-Agreement*. Have to voice an opinion.
		- Verbal Commitment from everyone. If you can't commit, we can't accomplish 'collectively'.
	- Conflict Continum
		<---Avoidance/False Harmony---------|Optimum|--------Personal Attacks--->
		
1.C Achieving Commitment
	Conflict supremely important - "If people can't weigh in, they can't buy in".
	- Don't decide by consensus. Too late. 'Disagree and Commit' is fine.
	- Disagreement tells us what to watch out for. What the 'pivot' points might be. Much better than passive agreement - where members nods but then don't do anything or provide any watch points. The result is that the first or foreseen failure, the "I told you so"s, come out.
	- Lastly, always walk out of a meeting with clear alignment and decisions. Make agreements so this is clear everyone is on point. Perhaps ask them to present to their teams. If you have to defend, they will want to know what happened and why the agreed.

1.D Accountability
	- Peer pressure: From the playground to to corporation, still the best way to learn.
	-- Rather than boss, peers holding accountable is much more effective. Used as learning vs punishment.
	- Boss cannot be 'Wuss'. If she is, her team will see it as:
		a. Poor performance is tolerated
		b. If the leader cannot hold someone accountable, then what's the point of me doing it.
		Au contraire, the more willing you are to hold individuals accountable, the less likely you are to do it. But build it with trust, not with personal attacks/conflicts.
	- Offsite Exercise: Write one good thing and one improvement trait for everyone in the room. Go around and discuss it.
	- Public vs Private: Argues for public accountability.
		- One: Everyone learns from the first person's mistakes.
		- Two: Even if leader is holding them to a standard, others wonder if you are holding folks accountable.
		- Three: It set that we are ok with holding each other accountable, and that reinforces within the team that this is ok.
		
1.E Results
	- Be focused on results - not on team. Results are what teams are for and what makes them better. (Hmmm, isn't this like org structure and org health?? Here we are arguing for health, not results of org structure components. But here we are saying look for results, not loyalt or team ??) 
	- Results are not financial, it's was the team defines as measures of success.
	- There need to be team goals - goals that we are collectively sharing and owning.
	- And always remember Team One. Team that you are a member of, not the one you own.	
	
Chapter 2: Creating Clarity
===========================
1. Why do we exist?
2. How do we behave?
3. What we do? (Simple)
4. How will we succeed (Strategy)
5. What is most important right now (Tactical/Execution)
6. Who is doing what? 

2.1: 

Chapter 3: Over-Communicate Clarity
===================================

* Getting the message across: It doesn't just take a clear power-point presentation and a great speech.
	- Message has to be heard over and over and be re-enforced by 'actions'.
	- The 'hearing' part is delt with in this chapter. The re-enforcement in the next.
* Hearing it over and over again		
	- Be Repetetive. It's Ok. CEO(s) should be CRO(s) - Chief Reminding Officers
* Cascading communication
	- Going top down is ofcourse a great way to communicate
	- Ensure you do it with your staff and as face to face as possible
	- Before leaving the meeting ensure the message is understood. Ensure they have consistent key take-aways for their employees.
	- Keep re-enforcing at every level
* Upward Communication
	- Ensure there are ways to reach back upwards as well. Remember communication isn't about telling. A message only gets across when they have clarified context and action.
	- They will need to ask questions to get buy-in and commitment and you need to let them ask these questions.
* Sideways/Lateral Communication
	- Leaders of departments need to resolve this.

Chapter 4: Re-enforce Clarity
=============================
* What does it take to ensure your actions are consistent with your messages and culture. A few key areas:
	- Recruiting & Hiring: Don't hire *just* for past experience. Hire for 'culture/core/permission-to-play' value fit.
	- Orientation: Organization is going to be making it's first impression. Make sure you make one that lasts.
	- Performance Measurement: Most suck. Why? Because they are 'legal' and beauraucratic and often tied to rewards.
		- Precisely because they are legal, you don't walk away with what's making you good or bad.
	- Rewards and Compenstation: Make sure compenstation is consistent with culture. 
		- If the employee didn't perform well on the team, it's ok to not reward them. And be transparent why they didn't. What you really need to see.
		- And if you couldn't get much more of a raise for a good person, be consistent and transparent.
	- Recognition: Be immediate and timely. Not recognizing is throwing money into the fire.
		- Do you have great employees. Have they done something great lately. If so, do *they* know?
		- The 'Anything' Example.
	- Firing: Don't be afraid to have people who don't embody your 'cultural fit' go.
